# CurryCompare hits the market
29th Dec 2023


## Summary
CurryCompare is a brand new way to review and discover curry. It is a feature-rich comparison website aimed at curry consumers and curry house owners. CurryCompare allows users to provide a detailed review of their meal and serves as a log of all their curry experiences. Users are able to search for curries and curry houses and filter by myriad criteria, such as a highly-rated chicken madras that is very hot. CurryCompare seeks to standardise the chilli rating scale employed by many curry houses by democratising it and providing an approximate Scoville rating.


## Customer Problem
Every day in Britain, curry aficionados up and down the country face many important questions. Where do they go to get their curry fix? Which of my locals has the best lamb bhuna? Take-away or dine-in? Is two chillies hot? How hot is hot? Is it BYOB? Do they deliver free poppadoms? So many questions, so few answers, and existing restaurant comparison services offer little help by only providing a surface-level rating.


## Proposed Solution
CurryCompare is an online web application that allows curry consumers to review curries in a level of detail hitherto unseen. Users can quantify the heat of their meal, portion size, taste, and price. Of course, users will also be able to provide a rating for their overall experience, as well as a brief written review. They can specify which curry they had, whether the meal was dine-in or take-away, whether the curry house was BYOB, and whether they provided free poppadoms. Users can also search for their next curry or curry house, able to filter by all of the previously mentioned factors a user can specify in a review.

## Customer FAQ

### Q: What are the ratings out of?
Users can quantify any of the mentioned factors as a rating out of 10, with 1 decimal place. E.g. 8.4.
### Q: Do I have to specify the heat of the meal etc?
No, a review only has 1 required component, and that is the overall rating.
### Q: Is there a CurryCompare mobile app?
At the moment CurryCompare is just a website, there is no mobile application.
### Q: As a curry house owner, can I remove reviews from my curry house?
No, but if you think the review violates the terms of service, you can flag the review and it will be checked.
### Q: As a curry house owner, how do I get my curry house on to CurryCompare?
You can add your curry house to CurryCompare by simply creating an account and ticking the ‘I run a curry house’ box.
